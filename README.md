## Blackjack Game

# Description

<b> To create a functioning Blackjack game that adheres to traditional Blackjack rules and determines and prints the winner based off said rules. The goal is to fully implement this program using OOP —including but not limited to enumerated classes and abstract classes— and keeping the deck separate from the game so that the deck could be used for other card games.

# Technologies Used

<b> Java, file i/o, Interfaces

# Lessons Learned

<b> I learned that I need to get better with the distinct terminology in the Java world. I also learned that since I've learned the art of instantiating and calling things, I've completely thrown passing through methods to the waste side and that's been to my detriment. This particular program required that the bass by value method be used a significant amount of times, and that was something I needed to re-learn how to use properly.
